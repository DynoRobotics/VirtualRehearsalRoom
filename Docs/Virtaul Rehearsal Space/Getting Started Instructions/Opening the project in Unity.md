The Unity Project can be downloaded or cloned from https://github.com/DynoRobotics/VirtualRehearsalRoom

After downloading it we can open the folder in Unity Hub (https://unity.com/download).

Make sure you have the 2021.3 LTS installed with at least Windows and Android build support.

It should be fine to open the project with a version that is not exactly 2021.3.11f but we recommend you use the same LTS at least.
