To be able to put multiple projects/shows in the same Unity project, we use a selectable settings object.

This settings object contains among other things:
* PUN network settings
* Scenes
* Simple avatars
* Full Body avatars
* Voice settings

We recommend that you create a folder under Assets in the Unity project that contains all assets related to the project.

Start by creating a subfolder to contain the new settings object.
You can create a new settings object by using Assets => Create => VirtualRehearsalRoomSettings.

Inspecting the new settings object should look something like this.

The new settings object will be inactive (or not selected) after you just created it. To make sure that the Unity project uses the new settings you can use the Virtual Rehearsal Room window.
