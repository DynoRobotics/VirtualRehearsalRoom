Now we are ready finally to try out the project in VR!

If you don't already have the Oculus Rift Software installed on your computer, start by downloading it from here: https://www.oculus.com/Setup/

After the software is installed and running, connect the USB 3 cable between the computer and the headset. You will need an Oculus Quest headset and a fast USB 3 cable for this method to work. You can get a cable that are made specifically made for this application, but there are some other cables that work also. Active USB C cables are especially likely to work and long cables that are not active are less likely to work.

In the headset navigate to Quest Link like in the picture below.

If everything is working, you should see the following window on the Quest. Press launch to connect the headset to your computer using Quest Link.

If it gets stuck in "Searching for PCs..." here, it might help to temporarily disconnect the USB cable and reconnect it again.

If connecting using a cable does not work for you, it you could have better luck using Air Link. You can switch to Air Link mode using the toggle at the top of the Quest Link window in last image.

After the headset is connected using Oculus Link, it should look something like this in VR.

Back in the Unity project, press the Login Scene button in the Virtual Rehearsal Room window.

This should start the project in the VR headset in the login scene. Here you can select player type. Make sure it says Audience above the connect button and press connect by pointing the beam from your right hand at the button and pressing the trigger on the right Oculus controller.

If you followed the earlier instructions and set the copied the scene with the mirror as starting scene, you should be able to see yourself in the mirror as you move around. The left joystick can be used to move and you can pick up the glowing ball using the grip buttons on the controllers.
